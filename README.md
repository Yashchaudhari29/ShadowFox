## Task 1: Documentation of Python Visualization Libraries

**File**: `Visualization_Libraries_Documentation.docx`

This document contains comprehensive documentation of two popular Python visualization libraries:
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Contents of the Documentation
- Overview of Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Installation instructions
- Basic plotting with examples
- Customization options
- Advanced plotting techniques

## Task 2: Delhi AQI Data Analysis

**Files**:
- `delhiaqi.csv`: The dataset containing air quality data from Delhi.
- `Delhi_AQI_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and AQI calculation.

This task involves analyzing the air quality in Delhi using the provided dataset. The notebook performs the following:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Calculation of AQI based on the dataset
- Visualization of trends and insights

### Key Steps
1. Importing necessary libraries and dataset
2. Data preprocessing and handling missing values
3. Calculating AQI using the specified formula
4. Visualizing the data for better understanding and insights

## Task 3: Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

**Files**:
- `Craigslist_Car_Prices.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for car price prediction analysis.
- `craigslist_car_data.csv`: Dataset scraped from Craigslist containing information about second-hand cars.

This task focuses on predicting the prices of second-hand cars using a dataset obtained from Craigslist. The notebook covers:
- Data scraping process
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of the model

### Key Steps
1. Data scraping and collection
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature selection and engineering
4. Training machine learning models for price prediction
5. Evaluating model performance

## Setup and Installation

To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
